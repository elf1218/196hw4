HEROKU: http://polar-ravine-2265.herokuapp.com/

HW8: Addons! Added email capabilities, specifically emails calendar creator when an event is made - tested it works. Overall, was pretty fun, mostly just following the guide from class. Had one bug that took me a while to figure out (had to sift through heroku logs which is difficult to interpret at first glance), turns out I made a typo so that was pretty unfortunate. Other than that, everything went quite smoothly.
