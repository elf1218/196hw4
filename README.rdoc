HW9: Queries. Made a bunch of changes here. Firstly, calendars (specifically calendar show) now display the first 5 events (sorted by time) with links. I use the Condition, Ordering and Limits queries here. Furthermore, both the events and calendars dropdowns now have "my" (my events, my calendars), which display all the events/calendars owned by the logged in person. I used the condition queries in both. Finally, the all events/all calendars tables no longer have the edit/delete functionality - this is now limited to the my events/my calendars tables - this way, you can't edit/delete other people's events!
