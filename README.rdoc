HW10: Javascript. Viewing the lists of calendars (my calendars/all calendars) now has a button that lets you expand out events below calendars!

Writing the JS itself wasn't particularly difficult, but there were a few major bugs that took forever to figure out. Firstly, my JS would stop working whenver I changed pages and I had no idea why for the longest time, until I googled it and finally figured out that it was to do with turbolinks, so I fixed that and it works! Also, heroku refused to load my JS at all until I precompiled assets, so that took a while to figure out too.
