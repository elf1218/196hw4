HEROKU: http://polar-ravine-2265.herokuapp.com/

HW6: again, fairly straight forward following the instructions from lecture - ran into some problems uploading to heroku, apparently heroku was complaining that I didn't have my private key set in devise. Read heroku error logs to figure that out. Otherwise, no real bugs.
