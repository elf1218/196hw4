HW7: Validations! I mainly had 2 fields I wanted to validate, the Calendar Title and the Event Description. For the calendar title, I decided it'd likely be less confusing if each calendar had a unique title, and therefore decided to validate its uniqueness. Furthermore, I thought it'd be a good idea for both calendar title and event desc to have to exist (presence: true) and less than 50 characters (being concise is good!). In total, I added 5 validations to those 2 fields.

Calendar had validates :title, presence: true, uniqueness: true, length: {maximum: 50}
Events had   validates :desc, length: {maximum: 50}, presence: true

I encountered no major issues just following the instructions for this project, and I think it worked out well!
