This project was pretty challenging at times, figuring out how to do things. Firstly, the layout for the site was shamelessly 'borrowed' from the site made in lecture (i.e. I copypasted application.css.scss and application.html.erb), since this hw was about setting up and accessing databases rather than making a site pretty (which we already did in hw2). As for the databases, I settled on the project idea from HW2, which was the calendar site - to this end, I created 3 tables: Users (containing username, password, and email), Calendars(with a title and a user that it belongs to), and Events (which have a time, description, user it belongs to, and calendar it belongs to). After this was planned out, the homework was primarily just following what happened in class - however, one interesting part was figuring out how to input a datetime for the Event time, and in http://guides.rubyonrails.org/form_helpers.html, I found select_datetime, which I used. The rest was fairly straightforward.
